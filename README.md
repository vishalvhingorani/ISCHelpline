# ISCHelpline
ISC Helpline is an educational platform built to guide you through the trenches of ISC Science. 

With limited resources available on the internet, most people have to resort to extra classes for their notes and this comes with its hefty fees. Well we're here to solve all your problems for free. Which is why we have compiled over 2500 pages of handwritten reference material and notes, right off the desks of the brightest students and rank holders.
